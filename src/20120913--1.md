# Apple goes south #

After a boring iPhone update and ugly iPods I decided to have a look into the iTunes Store: what's the current price for QuickMinder?

Expected were exorbitant USD 999.

I found: nothing, the app is gone from the store. iTunes Connect tells me everything is fine, no mail, nothing. Well, let's see what happens on the next morrow...

Changed it to USD 99.99 and it reappeared.
