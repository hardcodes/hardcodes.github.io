# HelloWorld! using a library on SailfishOS 2 #

This is the second edition of a little hello world project for SailfishOS that makes use of a library. It will show how you

* can build your own libraries
* present the properties therein to the QML layer
* deploy it with your SailfishOS application

You find the example on [Github](https://github.com/hardcodes/SFOSHelloWorldWithLibrary_02).

I am still not 100% happy with this version, but it is the only way I managed to use `TEMPLATE=subdirs` in `.pro` files with the SailfishOS SDK. Currently the [SDK expects the project directories to be arranged so that the 'rpm' directory is on the main project directory level](https://together.jolla.com/question/16802/bug-sdk-cant-handle-subdirs-template-on-osx/). And _that_ is exactly _not_ what I want. Well, it's doable, just put the main `.pro` file in the directory of your SFOS project.
