# 20131020 - Raspberry Pi crashes AKA "journal commit I/O error"

For some weeks I use my Raspberry Pi as kind of a [surveilance system](./20130924--1.md). It worked quite well but after some days it stopped working. At first sight the source of trouble seemed to be the wireless lan interface connected to the USB port. So I searched in the internet for a while and came across the `smsc95xx.turbo mode=n` setting in the `/boot/cmdline.txt` file. Much better then but still not perfect. After two weeks it stopped again and this time it didn't want to come alive. Well, it came alive but only for a short time until I tried to download a file via wireless interface. The terminal only showed many warnings like `journal commit I/O error` and that's all from that moment on.
After some internet seach I found [this page](http://elinux.org/Rpi_Hardware#How_Can_I_tell_if_the_power_supply_is_inadequate.3F) where they explained how to check the voltage.

*5.07 V* showed mine. Looked perfect. Then I booted to device while I was measuring and then the voltage dropped to 4.6V a few times. Multimeters are kind of slow so it must have been a huge drop. Needless to say that I used a _quality_ power supply from _Apple_. Seems to be the root cause for my problems.

I'm going to order a new power supply right _now_...
