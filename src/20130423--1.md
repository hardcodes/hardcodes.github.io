# Boost libraries and QtCreator on OSX - all together now #

After [first contact](./20130329--1.md) with the Boost libraries I faced [first obstacles](./20130331--1.md), [sorted them out](./20130418--1.md) and tried to [use them with QtCreator](./20130421--1.md). Upon subsequent reading some mails and forum entries this problem is not uncommon, but nobody provided a solution. So I used this journey to figure it out on my own.

Here is a follow up with the concentrated insight.

1. prepare the build process (this time all libraries)

```
export build=~/devtools # or wherever you'd like to build
cd $build/boost_1_53_0
# remove traces from the last time
./b2 --clean-all
rm project-config.jam*
# prepare
./bootstrap.sh
#output

Generating Boost.Build configuration in project-config.jam...
Bootstrapping is done. To build, run:
    ./b2
To adjust configuration, edit 'project-config.jam'.
Further information:
   - Command line help:
     ./b2 --help

```

2. build

```
./b2

The Boost C++ Libraries were successfully built!
The following directory should be added to compiler include paths:
    /Users/sven/devtools/boost_1_53_0
The following directory should be added to linker library paths:
    /Users/sven/devtools/boost_1_53_0/stage/lib
```

3. Change the `install_name` in all libraries

```
cd $build/boost_1_53_0/stage/lib
for DYNLIB in $(ls libboost*.dylib);do install_name_tool -id "$(pwd)/${DYNLIB}" "$(pwd)/${DYNLIB}";done
for OUTER in $(ls libboost*.dylib);do for INNER in $(ls libboost*.dylib);do install_name_tool -change "${INNER}" "@loader_path/${INNER}" ${OUTER};done;done
```

4. check one of them

```
otool -L $build/boost_1_53_0/stage/lib/libboost_filesystem.dylib /Users/sven/devtools/boost_1_53_0/stage/lib/libboost_filesystem.dylib:
	/Users/sven/devtools/boost_1_53_0/stage/lib/libboost_filesystem.dylib (compatibility version 0.0.0, current version 0.0.0)
	@loader_path/libboost_system.dylib (compatibility version 0.0.0, current version 0.0.0)
	/usr/lib/libstdc++.6.dylib (compatibility version 7.0.0, current version 52.0.0)
	/usr/lib/libSystem.B.dylib (compatibility version 1.0.0, current version 159.1.0)
```

5. configure usage in `.PRO` file of QtCreator

```
QMAKE_POST_LINK += ;/Developer/Tools/Qt/macdeployqt $${OUT_PWD}/$${TARGET}.app -no-strip
```

Done :-)
