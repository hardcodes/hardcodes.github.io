# Swing like a pendulum #

My zodiac sign could be Gemini because there have always been two hearts beat within my breast. One favors logic and thus computer stuff, the other one is my creative side, mostly bound to music somehow. Those two are opposed characters that don't show at the same time, just like Dr. Jekyll und Mr. Hyde. For a certain amount of time I stick to the logic side and suddenly I am all into music again. There is no moment of truth or trigger (at least I am not aware of such a thing) but at some point in time the preferences swap and voil√°: see you on the other side.

It has happened again. Now.

That means: right now it feels like *music was my first love...* and therefore I will certainly reduce my presence in any form of computer related stuff for some time. I'm not gone, just on the other side.
