# Windows7 icon cache corrupt

You use Windows7 and the icon cache is often corrupt? Maybe you have icons on your Desktop that refer to network drives? You want that fixed? During logon if possible?

Ay caramba!

Problem here is that it does not work during logon scripts, the cache must be rebuild afterwards.
Well, then - start it afterwards :-)

```
RUN "%ComSpec% /C ping 127.0.0.1 -n 5 > NUL 2>&1 & %windir%\system32\ie4uinit.exe -ClearIconCache"
```

This example uses [Kixtart](:http://www.kixtart.org/) as logon script language.
