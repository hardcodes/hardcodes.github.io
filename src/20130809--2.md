# #Snowden, #NSA, #cloud, #surveillance, #escape #

You heard of [Edward Snowden](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edward_Snowden) that's for sure.

Somehow you woke up and want out of the cloud.

If you used to use something like [Dropbox](https://www.dropbox.com) but don't want to miss the comfort, think about using [BitTorrent Sync](http://labs.bittorrent.com/experiments/sync.html). Choose a setup that works in your LAN only and you are fine.

One thing you might still miss: the Dropbox server was kind of a clearing instance and you didn't need to have at least two computers online to get things going. That's true, but think of using a [Raspberry Pi](http://www.raspberrypi.org) as the "always on" repository. Works just fine and is even faster.

**Update**

You might even consider using [Syncthing](https://syncthing.net/) instead of BtSync, because it is open source.
