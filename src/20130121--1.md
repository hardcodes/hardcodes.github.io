# NOTE: a missing vtable usually means the first non-inline virtual member function has no definition. Part 2 #

As mentioned in the last article I've added signals and slots to an existing class and ran into the linker error of a missing vtable.
No old or bad files in the source directory this time.

But lack of a `mod_nameofclass.cpp` file in the build directory.

Why? I ran `qmake` all the time to make sure that the build systems knows about the class now using the Qt macro system. After a while I decided to move the header file from `OBJECTIVE_HEADERS` to  `HEADERS` in the `.PRO` file. So far I chose `OBJECTIVE_HEADERS` because it is part of an Objective-C implementation file or to be more precise an `Objective-C++` implementation.

Guess what? Clean project, run qmake and build. Voil√°!

:-D
