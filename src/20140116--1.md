# HelloWorld! using a library on SailfishOS 1 #

This is just a little hello world project for SailfishOS that makes use of a library, to show how you

* can build your own libraries
* present the properties therein to the QML layer
* deploy it with your SailfishOS application

You find the example on [Github](https://github.com/hardcodes/SFOSHelloWorldWithLibrary_01).

AFAIK you should use the `SUBDIRS` template in project files to create projects that depend on self build libraries or other projects to be more generic. But so far I was not able to deploy them with the SailfishOS SDK.

*As of now this is just a workaround (IMHO)*.
