# Apple: a developers nightmare #

[This](http://www.theverge.com/2013/3/26/4148628/why-doesnt-icloud-just-work) is exactly the reason why I quit iOS development. Not the iCloud per se, but the way Apple communicates with developers. They just do *not*.

To make that clear: iOS development was just a hobby and I don't want to spend time on a frustrating hobby. Being paid for it would be still frustrating but better somehow ;-)
