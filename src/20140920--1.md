# Build ZeroMQ on OSX #

Download the latest tarball from [the ZeroMQ homepage](http://download.zeromq.org/zeromq-4.0.4.tar.gz). Untar/zip and `cd` into the directory.

```
./configure
make
sudo make install
```

do the trick.

## Add C++ bindings

Follow the instructions at the [ZeroMQ bindings page](http://zeromq.org/bindings:cpp). That is

- Build the ZeroMQ library and install it (see first topic).
- Choose one of the two bindings for C++: [C++ binding #1](https://github.com/zeromq/cppzmq) or [C++ binding #2](https://github.com/zeromq/zmqpp).
- Read the [C++ Api documentation](http://api.zeromq.org/zmq_cpp.html).
- Scratch your head and buy the book.
