# Cloning the Qt git repository into a corporate environment #

Let's assume you work inside a bigger company and want to clone the Qt git repository (or any other), there is a firewall and internet access via proxy only. Nothing out of the ordinary here and let's further assume that your company uses Windows workstations.

First thing needed is [Git for Windows](http://git-scm.com/).
Download. Install.

On Windows you get the _Git Bash_, a Unix like shell. Fire that up. You should end (or start) in you user directory. Set a Git property to use your proxy and clone the repository via HTTPS:

```
$ git config --global http.proxy YOURCOMPANYPROXYNAME:PROXYPORT
$ git clone https://git.gitorious.org/qt/qt5.git
```

Now learn that the perl version inside _Git Bash_ is outdated:

```
$ cd qt5
$ ./init-repository -help
"GetOptionsFromArray" is not exported by the Getopt::Long module
Can't continue after import errors at ./init-repository line 203
BEGIN failed--compilation aborted at ./init-repository line 203.
```

Download [Active Perl](http://www.activestate.com/activeperl/downloads), install it.

Use this perl version and learn that you have no certificates installed (the _-f_ is used to force the initialization of the repository, because the last try has left some information on disk).

```
$ /c/Perl64/bin/perl ./init-repository -f --http
# cut most lines
+ git fetch https://git.gitorious.org/qt/qtactiveqt.git
fatal: unable to access 'https://git.gitorious.org/qt/qtactiveqt.git/': SSL certificate problem: unable to get local issuer certificate
```

Be lazy, ignore security and fetch anyway:

```
$ env GIT_SSL_NO_VERIFY=true /c/Perl64/bin/perl ./init-repository -f --http
```

There you go.


*You want some more...*

If you also want to contribute and push your changes to Gerrit, you need some more:

Configure your [Gerrit account](http://qt-project.org/wiki/Setting-up-Gerrit), see *Log in with your public JIRA credentials*.
Start the _Git Bash_.

```
$ mkdir .ssh
$ cd .ssh
$ vi config
```

add the information for the Qt repository:

```
Host codereview.qt-project.org
ProxyCommand ncat --proxy YOURCOMPANYPROXYNAME:PROXYPORT  --proxy-type http %h %p
ServerAliveInterval 10
HostName ssh.qt-project.org
Port 443
User YOURGERRITUSERNAME
```

Replace the uppercase entries with the values for your account and the company's proxy.

On Unix systems you would probably see a _nc_ command to connect via proxy. This is not part of windows and does (sadly) not come with the _Git Bash_. There is an alternative:
Donwload [ncat for Windows](http://nmap.org/ncat/), install it and add the installation directory to your `PATH` environment variable. While you're on your way, _nmap_ is worth beeing added to your toolchain, too.

Cloning should be now possible via ssh:

```
$ git clone ssh://YOURGERRITUSERNAME@codereview.qt-project.org/qt/qtbase.git
```

So, you're able to tunnel the ssh connection, the rest should work just fine.
