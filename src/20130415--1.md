# Handling the program version with Qt, part 1 #

Usually your program has a version number (e.g. like 1.2.3) and you want to work with that number inside your program without changing that number in more than one file.

With Qt you configure your program with `.PRO` files which are a recipe for *qmake* the meta compiler that adds the Qt magic to your code. Both understand a variable called *VERSION*, that's the sunny part. On the dark side is the handling of it. At least on OSX there is none :-/

But it's quite easy to sneak a peak on that number from inside your program. While we are at it, we also add the *git* hash.
Just add

```
VERSION = 1.2.3
macx:HC_GITHASH  = $$system(git show HEAD|grep "^commit"|cut -c 8-)
# define c style macros to access the following values from inside the program
DEFINES += HC_PROGRAMVERSION=\\\"$$VERSION\\\"
DEFINES += HC_GITHASH=\\\"$$HC_GITHASH\\\"
```

to your *.PRO* file and that will result into two `#define` statements, or C-style macros in other words. Not perfect, because the compiler can't do type checking. On the other hand you're the boss and can handle those two values responsibly.

One question remains: how do we get this number into the application bundle (still talking OSX here), so that the user can right click (or CTRL-click) with the *Finder* and chose *get info*?.
