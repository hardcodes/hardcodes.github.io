# State Machines - Meeting C++ 2013 aftermath 1 #

At this years Qt Developer Days in Berlin there was a talk that mentioned [The State Machine Framework](http://qt-project.org/doc/qt-4.8/statemachine-api.html) from Qt but I didn't have the time to look into it. I just put it onto my never ending _to do_ list.

I was fortunate enough to also attend [Meeting C++ 2013](http://meetingcpp.de/index.php/mcpp2013.html) in Düsseldorf and watched [Christophe Henry's](http://meetingcpp.de/index.php/speakerview13/items/19.html) talk about [Asynchronous programming using the Boost Meta State Machine library](http://meetingcpp.de/index.php/talkview13/items/17.html). In the beginning of the talk Christophe gave a little overview of what a state machine basically is. I don't remember him mentioning the name but it looked like [Harel's Statecharts](http://www.wisdom.weizmann.ac.il/~dharel/SCANNED.PAPERS/Statecharts.pdf) also referenced from the Qt documentation.

The first thing that came to my mind was: _this can fundamentally change the way I code!._

Raise your hand if you never ended up in some kind of spaghetti code when GUI programming was involved and the transitions from one state into the other (funny, I even used to have the same kind of wording) were stored in a myriad of bool variables. I must confess of having done that.

For some time now I was pondering about a way to organize multi platform code. More or less clear was the idea of putting the _business logic_ into a library. This sounds quite easy in theory but providing a clean interface between your _data_, the _logic_ and the _GUI_ (= outside world) was not.
Well, here we are, *state machine* to the rescue.

What I really liked about Christophe's talk and the boost library was the way the code was organized and being the documentation at the same time. Even someone without a programming background could actually read this! (Stripped of all the comments that is. I am really sure that [Peter Sommerlad](http://meetingcpp.de/index.php/speakerview13/items/11.html) would have called them "_verboten!"_)

But then I remembered the earlier talk in Berlin where the Qt state machine was mentioned. What's the difference about the implementations? Which one would better suit my needs?

Reading the Qt documentation I came the conclusion that it is really hard wired to the Qt objects, signals and slots and so on. Not exactly what I had in mind and besides that, it's ugly (sorry):

```
//QStateMachine machine;
     QState *s1 = new QState();
     QState *s2 = new QState();
     QState *s3 = new QState();
//Then, we create the transitions by using the QState::addTransition() function:
     s1->addTransition(button, SIGNAL(clicked()), s2);
     s2->addTransition(button, SIGNAL(clicked()), s3);
     s3->addTransition(button, SIGNAL(clicked()), s1);
//Next, we add the states to the machine and set the machine's initial state:
     machine.addState(s1);
     machine.addState(s2);
     machine.addState(s3);
     machine.setInitialState(s1);
//Finally, we start the state machine:
     machine.start();
```

In the introduction of the [Boost Meta State Machine](http://www.boost.org/doc/libs/1_54_0/libs/msm/) there is a list of _snags_ of common state machine libraries, here is one example of how they might look:

```
state s1 = new State; // a state
state s2 = new State; // another state
event e = new Event; // event
s1->addTransition(e,s2); // transition s1 -> s2
```

Looks familiar?

So in the next few days I will give the [boost library](http://www.boost.org/doc/libs/1_54_0/libs/msm/doc/HTML/index.html) a chance. There is even a complete PDF inside the _doc_ folder in the library source code folder. Good for offline reading on the train.

_That's the way I like it…aha…aha_

[Tony van Eerd](http://meetingcpp.de/index.php/speakerview13/items/25.html) gave a quite longish but diverse and very interesting keynote at [Meeting C++ 2013](http://meetingcpp.de/index.php/mcpp2013.html) and besides many, many interesting topics he showed an image of a video game console (the brand doesn't really matter here) and talked about how the gamepad was the pure manifestation of a controller in the context of [Model View Controller](http://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model_View_Controller). The buttons on the gamepad are nothing more and nothing less: just buttons that don't know anything about the outside world. Not even their own status, they just tell a status change to the outside world.

I'm just catching a glimpse of an idea of how to organize GUI/code/programming in future. It may seem in a way more complicated than the classic approach but in the end it will pay off.

A big _thank you_ goes out to all the people involved in changing my way of thinking!

**Update**

On Jolla phone the boost libraries are currently not available. Seems that I have to look into the Qt state machine as well.
