# Building clang-format and friends on OSX Mountain Lion #

Apple provides you with the [clang](http://clang.llvm.org/index.html) compiler, so why should you want to compile it yourself? Because there are some utilities out there (e.g. [clang-format](http://clang.llvm.org/docs/Tooling.html)), that Apple does - for whatever reason - not bring to your Mac. Strange considering the fact that they are heavily involved into clang development. For Mr. and Mrs. Average those tools aren't needed on a Mac, that's for sure but for developers? Come on Apple, wake up!

Never mind, it's easy.

## Tools

Have a look at the [prerequisites](http://llvm.org/docs/GettingStarted.html#requirements) and install the tools that are not on your Mac, e.g. [auto tools](./20130123--1.md).

## Getting the sourcecode

Open you terminal and get download the code

```
$ # just for convenience
$ export build=~/devtools # or wherever you'd like to build
$ mkdir -p $build
$ cd $build
$ # first llvm, the basic infrastructure
$ svn co http://llvm.org/svn/llvm-project/llvm/trunk llvm
$ # followed by clang, the compiler
$ cd llvm/tools
$ svn co http://llvm.org/svn/llvm-project/cfe/trunk clang
$ cd ../..
$ # finally the tools, the reason for this all here
$ cd llvm/tools/clang/tools
$ svn co http://llvm.org/svn/llvm-project/clang-tools-extra/trunk extra
$ cd ../../../..
```

## Build

### llvm and clang

```
$ mkdir -p $build/clang
$ cd $build/clang
$ # As I already have a clang package from Apple that I don't want to mix up,
$ # I do not provide --prefix here
$ ../llvm/configure --enable-libcpp --enable-cxx11 --enable-debug-symbols=no --enable-optimized
$ $ ls
Makefile	bindings	docs		lib		runtime		unittests
Makefile.common	config.log	examples	llvm.spec	test		utils
Makefile.config	config.status	include		projects	tools
$ # compiling will take some timeâ€¦almost an hour on my computer
$ make
```

### clang-tools

The tools were automatically build, too.

Just go on, have a look in `$build/clang/Release+Asserts`. If you want to have a glimpse on what those tools can do for you, watch [Chandler Carruth's](:http://channel9.msdn.com/Events/GoingNative/2013/The-Care-and-Feeding-of-C-s-Dragons) talk from _Going Native 2013_.
