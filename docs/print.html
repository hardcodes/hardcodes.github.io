<h1><a class="header" href="#jumpy-on-amiga" id="jumpy-on-amiga">Jumpy on Amiga</a></h1>
<p>Jumpy is quite old, you know. Back in the year 1989 it began jumping around on the world famous Amiga. Now that name was blocked in the iTunes AppStoreÂ® so Jumpy got JumpyRally.</p>
<p><img src="./gfx/38.jpg" alt="" /></p>
<p><img src="./gfx/39.jpg" alt="" /></p>
<p>I had started Jumpy as a personal &quot;science&quot; project back in school. It served my well in learning assembler for the Motorola 68000. One lesson was &quot;do not use hardcoded values&quot;. And there you go: it's the perfect name for this site.</p>
<h1><a class="header" href="#i-need-space" id="i-need-space">I need space</a></h1>
<p>There is this fruity company from Cupertino, giving a development environment to the people, called Xcode. It's free (as in free beer not as in free speech). It's buggy (sorry to say that - but it really is) and I often wonder if any of the people at Apple HQ ever tried to use it on a Macbook pro 13&quot;?</p>
<p>As of today it is still buyable hardware on their store, so they should have tried it. What I am ranting about is this:</p>
<p><img src="./gfx/4.jpg" alt="" /></p>
<p>Now compare this to AppCode:</p>
<p><img src="./gfx/5.jpg" alt="" /></p>
<p>You get the difference, don't you?</p>
<p>Yes, I could use those buttons in the upper right corner to get more space in the editor. And ten seconds after that I may need the left or right pane again, move the mouse pointer all the way up and change it back. Then I need more space...</p>
<p>And for the clever ones mumbling something like keyboard shortcut: have you ever tried those on a German keyboard? Vulcans may like that, I do not!</p>
<h1><a class="header" href="#no-filesystem-needed" id="no-filesystem-needed">No filesystem needed?</a></h1>
<p>Although I like using my iPad, the invisible is one major drawback. Thanks to <a href="http://www.imore.com/2012/06/18/ios-6-passbook-filesapp/">Rene Ritchie</a> I know that I am not alone at last.</p>
<p>The average user doesn't know about filesystem details and perhaps doesn't want to know but if you try to use a device like an iPad in a productive or even professional manner, you will come to the point where a filesystem is needed.</p>
<p>On a PC or Mac it is not uncommon to work on one file (or call it chunk of data if you don't care that it is actually a file) with more than one application, maybe because each has that single feature that is needed to make progress. Yes, apps can exchange files on iOS but it's crippled and there is no way to be sure that one app can give one received file back. The cloud could be the solution for this but every App developer has to reinvent the wheel if he/she wants to support iCloud and/or Dropbox and/or ...</p>
<p>One place outside the App sandbox where every app can read/write would be fine and just like iOS prevents the starting of unknown (AKA unsigned) apps it could ensure that nothing can be ever executed from this filesystem.</p>
<p>Would this be the Ãœberfilesystem? ;-)</p>
<h1><a class="header" href="#one-way-globalization" id="one-way-globalization">One-way globalization</a></h1>
<p><img src="./gfx/8t.png" alt="" /></p>
<p>You sure did hear about globalization, it's affecting all of us whether you live in Europe, the U.S. or any other place of the world. Thousands of jobs were downsized in one part of the world to be replaced by cheaper workers in another country. Resources are transported and distributed in all parts of the world to create and produce a product in the most cost effective way. Lower the cost and raise the profit. Probably the device you are reading this on was not produced, not even assembled the country you live in.
This works quite well as long you don't try to globalize for yourself.</p>
<p>It started some years ago with <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regional_lockout">regional lockout</a>. This way the provider of digital content are in control where you can consume and what price you got to pay (different markets offer different prices).</p>
<p>Well, isn't that nice?</p>
<p>Reducing the costs is just fine as a producer but is a major no-no for you as a customer.</p>
<p>Don't get me wrong - the creators of content must be paid. No doubt about that. And there are many people in this world who are <a href="http://www.forbes.com/sites/erikkain/2012/05/09/hbo-has-only-itself-to-blame-for-record-game-of-thrones-piracy/">willing to pay</a>. Hello? There are people who want to spend their money.
But they can't!</p>
<p>If you live in the wrong place of this world you got no chance to get that digital content. Here in Germany all TV shows are synchronized so they will be aired much later than in the U.S. (most TV shows are still produced there). But I want to see the original version with native speakers. I don't need the synchronized version and guess what: I do not even watch it! Yes, there are some (not so legal) ways to stream right from the US (be it iTunes, Netflix, Hulu or Amazon).
Dear content providers: don't blame piracy if you reject peoples money. You could <a href="http://theoatmeal.com/comics/game_of_thrones">learn from them</a>. Why should I go through all that hassle when torrent is so much easier?
Shouldn't the legal way be the easy one?</p>
<h1><a class="header" href="#itil-burger-anyone" id="itil-burger-anyone">ITIL burger anyone?</a></h1>
<p>Currently my girlfriend and I are lying on the sofa after we had an accidential meal: spaghetti with salmon, spinach and onions. It didn't turn out as expected but was delicious after all. Yeah, that actually happens if you really cook for yourself. That reminded me of <a href="http://www.joelonsoftware.com/articles/fog0000000024.html">Big Macs vs. The Naked Chef</a>. No, I would not call me a chef but the self created food is by far better than from Mc Donald's.
Any fast-food chain like Mc Donald's has a pedantic set of rules and methodologies that ensure the same customer experience in any branch at any place in the world. It does not matter if you order your Bic Mac in New York, Rio or Tokyo. It will taste exactly the same. They call this quality which is newspeak for average food made by morons.</p>
<p><img src="./gfx/6.jpg" alt="" /></p>
<p>Suddenly it struck me that the same goes for <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information_Technology_Infrastructure_Library">ITIL (Information Technology Infrastructure Library)</a>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;The Information Technology Infrastructure Library (ITIL), is a set of practices for IT service management (ITSM) that focuses on aligning IT services with the needs of business.[...]ITIL describes procedures, tasks and checklists that are not organization-specific, used by an organization for establishing a minimum level of competency.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Have you ever called a service line to get support for your computer or any other technical device? Those call center agents use a flow chart to classify your problem and hopefully direct you to a competent person that can solve it for you. But there are these (not so rare) moments where your problem does not fit in. They have no flow chart, no rule to follow and you can feel the blue screen of death that paralyses the lubricated service machine (metaphorically spoken). Eventually they will keep you in the &quot;keep the customer busy&quot; routine hoping that the problem solves itself or that you give up.</p>
<p>And companies that implemented ITIL have brought the rules to perfection even more if they follow(ed) the ITIL rules by the letter not considering if those rules apply to their business or the culture of their product/customers. Here we go again: there is a set of rules that guarantee a &quot;high&quot; level of quality of service (vide supra) brought to you by a bunch of stupid morons. ITIL is not a bad thing at all, don't get me wrong but it is often implemented by people who are somehow fixated on the process of implementing itself that they loose sight for the big picture.</p>
<p>Now if you buy service from an ITIL compliant company ask yourself if you really want the average? Is that what you pay for? </p>

<p>Not knowing what was wrong with the old dialog I wonder why they throw away decades of UI design knowledge and present buttons that do not set apart from the background.</p>

<p>Well, I hope my data is safe with Apple since it can not be accessed 8). Joking aside that just happens with Apple's (latest) Safari browser for Windows, Firefox works (and that is extraordinary, or should I say magic?).</p>
<p>They got too fast too big I fear.</p>
<p>Maybe the problem is caused by some Microsoft security updates - there was same trouble regarding certificates lately. But Apple should be aware of this if they build Software for the Windows platform.</p>
<p><em><strong>Update</strong></em></p>
<p>The problem is caused by the SSL gateway that is used in our company. That little thingy basically works like a man-in-the-middle attack and sniffs into the network traffic for viruses. Therefore it issues a new certificate that is sent to the browser. The browser will accept the new certificate because it was fed with the root certificate of the SSL gateway. Since this works fine with IE and Firefox I still think it a bug in Safari, because it doesn't even show the certificate path.</p>

<p>Tonight Apple will present the next iteration of iPhone and iOS6 is about to come.</p>
<p>Will it bring wanted features? Yes!</p>
<p>Will it bring more pain to developers? Yes!</p>
<p>The latter is the reason that I will give up developing for iOS in the near future. Since I did this a hobby that's not a big loss for the fruit company and neither for me. It's my spare time and I don't need to fill it with pain. Maybe I will be paid in future to endure this pain then I will speak Objective-C again.</p>
<p>It was fun also and a big thank you goes out to all who bought QuickMinder and the little but impressive crew that made the beta testing.
I've learned a lot on that way and that's what &quot;coding just for fun&quot; is all about.</p>
<p>What has that to do with USD 999?</p>
<p>Nothing.</p>
<p>Almost nothing.</p>
<p>I've decided to test if raising the price to the max for 1 day would cause any eruptions.</p>
<p>Like: would one really buy the app for this price? I doubt that. Will it raise a red flag somewhere? Will it put the app in front of the iTunes store? I don't know but I am curious :-)</p>
<h1><a class="header" href="#apple-goes-south" id="apple-goes-south">Apple goes south</a></h1>

<p>Changed it to USD 99.99 and it reappeared.</p>

<p>You've upgraded your iPod, iPhone or iPad to iOS6 and now the &quot;Autosend&quot; feature of QuickMinder doesn't work anymore?</p>
<p>Well, bad luck! Blame Apple and not me. For some obscure reasons they've raised the bar of &quot;security&quot; to a new level. But this time it isn't really about security, they don't want that the mail view in iOS can be used this way. This is not by accident, Apple <em>invented</em> bad user &amp; developer treatment.</p>
<p>If you've bought QuickMinder, I am very thankful for that! But I am sorry to tell you, that Apple has made it impossible to reactivate this feature ever again! This is sad for you, because I think it was a very useful feature in QuickMinder and made life easier. It's sad for me (sad is not the right word, but more polite) and made me come to the only decision that is appropriate here: I will stop developing for iOS. In the end that doesn't hurt Apple and it doesn't hurt me.</p>

<p>In the last weeks there were some severe security breaches in the Java world. Most of them had in common that a Java applet was started using a browser on a prepared website. Personally I've switched of the use of Java applets on all machines/browsers, so I should be quite safe.</p>
<p>Today I've stumbled upon a feature in Firefox: <code>click_to_play</code>  --- it's not so very hot and new as a little googleing showed.</p>
<p>This tiny little boolean controls whether Firefox starts plugins etc. while browsing the web.</p>
<p>So, I didn't know about this feature. Why? Because you have to dive into that longish about:config page that controls/shows the Firefox settings behind the scene. Behind the scene is all my today's rant is about: make it default AND make a checkbox somewhere on the security tab in the options/preferences. You'd be surprised: users could use that feature. And it's spelled USErs.</p>

<p>In our company we use Lotus Notes (yeah, pity me now). Not only is Lotus Notes an ugly email client it is also used for collaboration, which goes for me as far as using a calendar.</p>
<p>Now what do you think if you can see this? (just ignore the German names here for a little moment)</p>
<p><img src="./gfx/27.jpg" alt="" /></p>
<p>I don't know what you think but I think of a dropdown box. Using Windows since version 3.11 (and knowing since version 2) and many other graphical user interfaces some sort of conditioning took place. If I see that little downwards looking arrow on the right side, I am sure there is a dropdown box hiding.</p>
<p><img src="./gfx/28.jpg" alt="" /></p>
<p>And it would make perfectly sense here: you often need to change the month (quickly) and 12 months = 12 items that fit well in a dropdown box. That would even work on VGA standard resolution.
Knowing and expecting that my eyes focus the area under the GUI element.</p>
<p>Then a click...</p>
<p>Bazinga!</p>
<p>I'm getting a tiny calendar.</p>
<p><img src="./gfx/29.jpg" alt="" /></p>
<p>The eyes start looking for orientation, perceive the current month on top of the box (that isn't even exactly under the previous GUI element. It partly hides it and is slightly shifted to the left), jump back to the calendar.
Where are my months?</p>
<p>Cognition.</p>
<p><img src="./gfx/30.jpg" alt="" /></p>
<p>The arrows on the upper left and right are for flipping to the previous or next month. In my eyes this little task got already complicated for exactly that purpose: flipping to the previous or the next month.</p>
<p>But what if I want to skip several months?</p>
<p>click, clickedy, click, click.</p>
<p>Sorry folks, but what in the name of did the designers of Lotus Notes think here?
And now think again about the German names for days and months. Oh, how can I express my deep love for this kind of software?</p>
<h1><a class="header" href="#old-habits" id="old-habits">Old habits</a></h1>
<p>With my iPad came the &quot;need&quot; for the iCloud and at this point I started using Apple's Safari browser. Being a &quot;switcher&quot; from Windows I was used to Internet Explorer and much more to Firefox. The latter was my browser of choice when I entered the universe of Jobs. But synchronizing the bookmarks between the iPad and my desktop computer made totally sense, so I gave Safari a try.</p>
<p>Nope, this is not about which browser is better or the best at all.</p>
<p>It's about some GUI detail that took me by surprise.</p>
<p><img src="./gfx/31.jpg" alt="" /></p>
<p>So this was Safari after all. Not so unusual, isn't it? Besides having the bookmarks on the desktop, too, it felt like it should. Hey it's a browser, not the holy grail.
Until...</p>
<p>...I wanted to search something in Google. Simple enough, one could think. Yes, but...</p>
<p>...where is the textfield for the search term?</p>
<p>Where should I enter what I was looking for?</p>
<p>Lacking any alternative I entered the words in the URL bar and voilÃ¡ I was in Google.
And of course, it is so simple to differ betweens URLs and search terms, just using a regex.</p>
<p>What really struck me was the question &quot;why on earth have so many browsers two textfields for that?&quot;
Because there work geniuses at Apple?</p>
<p>Well, have you seen Safari on IOS? These little devices with really small screen real estate? One should think that these are exactly the kind of devices that have born the idea of just using one textfield. And then they brought it &quot;Back To The Mac&quot;.</p>

Part 1</a></h1>
<p>Currently I am trying to learn C++ and using the Qt framework. Every now and then the linker complains &quot;NOTE: a missing vtable usually means the first non-inline virtual member function has no definition.&quot;</p>
<p>So far, so good.</p>
<p>I've googled what that means in detail and hunted down most of the bugs that caused this &quot;message of horror&quot;. But right now I am sitting in front of a piece of code that is, well, correct. At least I can't see any errors and not why the linker complains. My fault for sure. Let's see where this journey ends.</p>
<p>Some articles gave a hint for a new run of the moc compiler to create the stuff that comes in your code with <code>QObject</code>. That sounded sane first, because I have added <code>QObject</code> to the class later during coding to use signals and slots. It was a pure C++ class first. On the other hand I have done the clean/run qmake routine some times now - just to be sure.</p>
<p>But curiosity led to me to have a closer look to the filesystem, since the moc compiler should create some files in the destination directory. It did. The mess was in the source directory: I had changed a class from <code>.CPP</code> to <code>.MM</code> because it got some Objective-C code. Well, QtCreator left the <code>.CPP</code> file where it was and made a new copy. Thus during compiling this file caused the trouble (what is somehow mysterious in itself: the <code>.CPP</code> file wasn't mentioned in the <code>.PRO</code> file).</p>
<p>Never totally trust your IDE ;-)</p>
<p>Ok, all is fine now...should be...added a signal and a slot and even after the clean/run qmake routine <em>the</em> message comes again.</p>
<p><img src="./gfx/34.jpg" alt="" /></p>
<p>But that's another story...!</p>
<h1><a class="header" href="#note-a-missing-vtable-usually-means-the-first-non-inline-virtual-member-function-has-no-definition-part-2" id="note-a-missing-vtable-usually-means-the-first-non-inline-virtual-member-function-has-no-definition-part-2">NOTE: a missing vtable usually means the first non-inline virtual member function has no definition. Part 2</a></h1>
<p>As mentioned in the last article I've added signals and slots to an existing class and ran into the linker error of a missing vtable.
No old or bad files in the source directory this time.</p>
<p>But lack of a <code>mod_nameofclass.cpp</code> file in the build directory.</p>
<p>Why? I ran <code>qmake</code> all the time to make sure that the build systems knows about the class now using the Qt macro system. After a while I decided to move the header file from <code>OBJECTIVE_HEADERS</code> to  <code>HEADERS</code> in the <code>.PRO</code> file. So far I chose <code>OBJECTIVE_HEADERS</code> because it is part of an Objective-C implementation file or to be more precise an <code>Objective-C++</code> implementation.</p>
<p>Guess what? Clean project, run qmake and build. VoilÃ¡!</p>

<p>A while ago I wrote about <a href="./20120926--1.html">useless features</a>. Mozilla put the great &quot;click to play&quot; function into Firefox but forgot to tell the users about it. This feature <del>is</del> was really cool. When loading a webpage all plugins weren't loaded, just a placeholder. Improved security (can you say Flash?) and speed. On the other hand the user could start a specific plugin on demand.</p>
<p>After the last update Firefox brings up a popup on every page that has plugins.</p>
<p><img src="./gfx/35.jpg" alt="" /></p>
<p>If you choose &quot;not now&quot;, you will see this popup every time you visit the page again. Yeah, a built-in nag screen, come on Mozilla hurt me plenty.
If you choose &quot;Never activate plugins for this site&quot;, you get what you want. Or not? Well, the site is loaded without any plugins, that's true. But what if I want to activate a specific one? No, no my friend, there is only all or nothing. If you want to change the setting, you must click on the blue brick that is shaped like a kids toy.</p>
<p>So there remains &quot;Always activate plugins for this site&quot;. You want or must use a plugin for a site. Then you got no choice, you must activate it for the whole page. No more security, no more download speed.</p>
<p>And last but not least there are some sites with the old behavior, quite confusing.</p>
<p>Thank you Mozilla.</p>

<p>Well, it's time to apply the latest patch to the Adobe Flash Player. Besides being a pain in the neck (because it happens so often - I wonder if the suicide rate of enterprise admins correlates with that), it's no problem on the Mac. Go to preferences, start the Adobe Flash Player preferences pane, click &quot;Advanced&quot;, click &quot;Check Now&quot;. A web service is called or just an URL is checked - I don't know and I don't want to know - and you get the message that a new update is available. Then you are asked if you want to download and apply it.</p>
<p>Easy as pie.</p>
<p><em>Of course you can wait until the auto update mechanism tells you that there is an update.</em></p>
<p>Now look at the control panel from Windows:</p>

<p>What would you expect to happen if you click on &quot;Check Now&quot;? Same as above? Don't be so naive.

<p>Time to update Java again, come and join the fun - NOT.</p>
<p><img src="./gfx/46.jpg" alt="" /></p>
<p>Not only that keeping Java up to date seems to be very time consuming lately but to uncheck this damned checkbox each and every time is annoying.</p>
<p><em>P.S.: Yes, I can smile :-) Don't think I am all about ranting.</em></p>
<h1><a class="header" href="#ios-most-wanted-updated" id="ios-most-wanted-updated">iOS most wanted (updated)</a></h1>
<p>Here is my own personal list of features I miss most in the Apple universe:
<em>just for the record, most of those items here were written while I was still on iOS 5.1</em></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><em>Date</em> Why the heck don't you display the current date next to the time? Can't be that hard. Yes, there is a calendar app but that's not the point and it's not even 100 % sure that it shows the current day!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Store wishlists</em> This one goes for every store there is so far: iTunes, Appstore. iTunes U is a separate app now, podcast will become with iOS 6 but under hood they still use iTunes - I guess.
Sometimes there is something interesting to be found and you are not 100 % sure if you want to buy it. Or maybe in case of a movie you're missing the right company ;-)</p>
<p>Wouldn't it be nice to drop such items on a wishlist? Look at Amazon. They know the way. By the way: iTunes and Appstore are crap, Apple could learn so much from Amazon there. (It's so hard to find something in iTunes/Appstore even if you have a precise idea of what you are looking for)</p>
<p>Developers can't even change the keywords or category of an app once it's gone online :-/</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Free trials</em> Developing software is hard work and therefore it is no miracle that developers want to sell their software on the Appstore and not give it away for free. That is totally fine and they should get their money if they did a good job. But here is the problem: how to find out if they did a good job? On the Appstore it's first buy and then...maybe be happy or maybe suffer.</p>
<p>Often there are light versions for free to be found on the store but these versions are intentionally crippled. Developers must cripple them, they got no other choice. If those versions were feature complete, nobody would buy the &quot;full&quot; version even if the customer is satisfied - they are selfish humans in the end. But a crippled version doesn't necessarily show me how good the full version is.</p>
<p>Wouldn't it be nice if you could try the full version for - let's say - one week? If you don't like it, it simply should stop working after that period. If you decide to buy then - and only then - you can install it on another device. The user experience should be the same with every app and the user should not be able to bypass it - there you go, it must be implemented on OS level.</p>
<p>I think that would make both developers and customers very happy.</p>
<p>Have a look at this article from <a href="http://osxdaily.com/2013/02/26/5-improvements-features-the-ios-app-store-badly-needs/">OSX Daily</a>. I am not alone :-)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Filesystem</em> Although I can somehow understand the approach Apple took in completely hiding the filesystem, I still <a href="./20120619--1.html">want that feature</a>! Nothing Windows 8 has shown so far makes me really happy or even want to change. But the access to the filesystem could make the difference! <em>Update</em> Have a look at Blackberry 10. They have sandboxed Apps and a way to share data via filesystem.</p>
<p>Apps like <a href="http://9to5mac.com/2013/02/28/review-files-is-the-finder-for-ios-youve-been-waiting-for/">Files</a> (article on 9to5mac) are not the solution as the developers have to follow (or is obey the better word?) the same restrictions</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Keyboard navigation</em> Writing on a touch device with only visual feedback is pain in itself. If you misspelled something and want to correct it, iOS gets nasty. Your only chance is tapping in the text field, wait 3 seconds and shift the magnifying glass. Oh there is another bug, tap again, wait 3 seconds, adjust the magnifier and so on and so on. Screen real estate is precious, but please: put at least cursor left/right on the keyboard.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Save as PDF</em> Ever found a website and wanted to print it to a PDF? Me too! PDF support is built in iOS but as Apple decided that there is no need of a filesystem (I keep on repeating) they thought it would not be necessary to save a website content. Yes, I know the concept of bookmarks but the web changes as you may know. If any app that supports opening of PDFs could be targeted with the print output, such a file could be saved to Dropbox or any other cloudy kind of storage.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>AirPlay Mirroring</em> Yeah, there is some AirPlay Mirroring in iOS. But I want mirror any device to any other device, like iPod to iPad, my Mac to my iPad and any other combination that makes sense regarding screen resolution. How many OS generations shall we wait? Money for developers shouldn't be Apple's problem right now.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Easy data exchange</em> Ever tried to paste the URL of a Youtube video (from the Youtube app) to Facebook? Did you ever try to attach a picture from inside the Mail app? (Or worse: data from another non-Apple-App)</p>
<p>Then you know what I am talking about.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>SMS on iPad</em> If you have an iPad with 3G network it would be nice to be able to send and receive SMS. It even works with cheap UMTS/WLAN modems, why not with the high prized iPad?
And for those who say &quot;use mail or messages&quot;: yeah, and what if I need to tweak my dataplan via SMS? There are countries in this world where they got unregistered prepaid SIM cards.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Close all recently used apps</em> If you press the home button or swipe up with four fingers you get a list of the recently used apps. That's nice if there were only a few in this list but after a while it gets filled up and thus useless. What is a list good for that's more complicated to search in than restarting the app from the &quot;desktop&quot; icon? It ain't real multitasking: the most apps in background don't get a single cpu cycle. Please bring a button to close them all.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Improved bookmark editing</em> With Safari on a Mac you can (like with any other browser) edit, sort and search your bookmarks using the complete screen real estate. No big problem if you only got a few, but I've got many of them, because Safari completes the URL for me if it's in the bookmarks.</p>
<p>BTW: why is it not possible to add/edit/use the stored bookmarks on the iCloud website?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>PDF with index</em> Yepp, iOS can show you a PDF file (and I haven't found one that can not be shown, but there will be sure files outside that can't), you can scroll up/down, pinch in/out just fine.
But it lacks the capability of showing and using the index of the PDF (if it has one).</p>
<p>What a bummer!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Better WiFi</em> Compared to my Macs the WiFi is sometimes bumpy and sluggish. Fix that, damn it! And while you are at it: I want to delete entries from &quot;known networks&quot;.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Bluetooth</em> Bluetooth, you are asking? but my i* has Bluetooth! Yes it has. But only for keyboards and headphones. Ever tried to exchange data with a non-Apple-device? Even more than ten year old phones can do that without problems. It simply works there :-/</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Shuffle playlists</em> &quot;Wait a moment, my iTunes has a shuffle function&quot; you say? Well, yes it does have something that is called shuffle but in my eyes that is the world's worst manifestation of such a thing. Yours truly associates shuffle with random playlists and sorry dear reader: the playlists on iTunes are in no random order at all (if shuffle is activated, of course). And before you mention it, yes I know there isn't such a thing as &quot;chance&quot; from a computerized random generator. So the art is in seeding that thing in such a way that it appears naturally to us humans. But that Apple shuffle algorithm prefers songs you have listened often to and therefore becomes a self-fulfilling prophecy. Songs played in shuffle mode are then preferred to be played in shuffle mode because they have been played more often (in shuffle mode). Hooray, but I want to hear a random selection of all my songs. Even with dynamic playlists and some clever rulesets you can't emulate that.</p>
<p>By the way and off topic: thanks to Apple you can't even see the order of the shuffled songs.</p>
<p>Do they even use that software to hear music?</p>
<p>If you still don't believe me: sync you iPod with you iTunes on your Mac. Start a shuffle play of some playlist on the computer for ten (or even hundred ) songs. Start a shuffle play on your iPod on the same playlist a week (!) or a month (!) later and you will hear exactly the same order of songs. Year, the blinded devotees will call that a feature...</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Upgraded to 6.1.3</strong></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Sync iTunes U</em> Wouldn't it be nice to have course subscriptions from the iPad to show up in iTunes on your Mac (and vice versa)?</p>
</li>

<p><a href="http://www.theverge.com/2013/3/26/4148628/why-doesnt-icloud-just-work">This</a> is exactly the reason why I quit iOS development. Not the iCloud per se, but the way Apple communicates with developers. They just do <em>not</em>.</p>
<p>To make that clear: iOS development was just a hobby and I don't want to spend time on a frustrating hobby. Being paid for it would be still frustrating but better somehow ;-)</p>
<h1><a class="header" href="#boost-libraries-on-osx---first-contact" id="boost-libraries-on-osx---first-contact">Boost libraries on OSX - first contact</a></h1>
<p>So here I am, still learning C++ and using the Qt framework. Recently I wanted to know how much disk space is left on a device, so that I can decide if an operation takes place at all.</p>
<p>Surprisingly there is nothing in the regular Qt framework. There seem to be some leftovers in a part of the mobile framework from the Nokia days. But those are not in the distribution that can be downloaded from the Qt project page.</p>
<p>After some research in the forum and our friend Mr. Google I stumbled over the Boost libraries (again - it wasn't for the first time). So I went over to their homepage and hit the</p>
<p><img src="http://www.boost.org/style-v2/css_0/get-boost.png" alt="Image source: http://www.boost.org/style-v2/css_0/get-boost.png" /> button.</p>
<p>Most parts of the boost libraries are header only, they need no compiling at all. Whut? Yes, they are a bunch of clever templates that do all the work for you. So, download, unzip and there you go (have a look in their <a href=":http://www.boost.org/doc/libs/release/more/getting_started/index.html">getting started guide</a>.</p>
<p>But I wanted something that works with the filesystem and is platform-independent. That's the part where some compiling comes into place. Part of the download was the <a href="http://www.boost.org/doc/libs/1_53_0/libs/filesystem/doc/index.htm">Boost.Filesystem library</a>. How to compile is described <a href="http://www.boost.org/doc/libs/1_53_0/more/getting_started/unix-variants.html#prepare-to-use-a-boost-library-binary">here</a>.</p>
<p>So why is he writing all that stuff here if everything is documented on the Boost homepage? Well, that's kind of a self-therapy. By writing down the steps needed, I can memorize them better and if I need the information in future, I know where to find it. Beyond that it's written in my own language using my wording. Basically the same information but it goes faster into my brain. Last but not least there is the fact that you have understood it for yourself when you can tell others how to do it.</p>
<p>Open you terminal and there you go.</p>
<p>Make a directory where the Boost libraries go and put the downloaded file there</p>
<pre><code>export build=~/devtools # or wherever you'd like to build
mkdir -p $build
cd $build
</code></pre>
<p>I could have put a fancy curl command here but since I wanted that get Boost button in here, I assume that you put the file in there with Finder.</p>
<pre><code>tar -xzf boost_1_53_0.tar.gz
</code></pre>
<p>Go into the new boost_1_53_0 directory and for a first glance enter</p>
<pre><code>./bootstrap.sh --help

<p>OK, we wanted something for the filesystem and surprise, surprise: it's called filesystem.</p>
<p>The option --with-libraries tells that bootstrap script which library to build (if not all and I just want that file thingy). On top of that we can use --prefix to tell where the build library goes in our filesystem. Long story short:</p>

The Boost C++ Libraries were successfully built!
The following directory should be added to compiler include paths:

The following directory should be added to linker library paths:

    /Users/sven/devtools/boost_1_53_0/stage/lib
</code></pre>
<p>Yes, there you go: it reads The Boost C++ Libraries were successfully built! :-) And there is also the most important hint:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>The following directory should be added to linker library paths:</em>
<em>/Users/sven/devtools/boost_1_53_0/stage/lib</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>That is nice! I like it when toolsets are that easy to build and use.
One step left. I want to use it with Qt/QtCreator, so add that information to the .PRO file</p>
<pre><code>LIBS += /Users/sven/devtools/boost_1_53_0/stage/lib -lboost_filesystem -lboost_system
INCLUDEPATH += /Users/sven/devtools/boost_1_53_0
</code></pre>
<p>One could think that</p>
<pre><code>LIBS += /Users/sven/devtools/boost_1_53_0/stage/lib
INCLUDEPATH += /Users/sven/devtools/boost_1_53_0
</code></pre>
<p>is enough, but the compiler complains here (hey, I am still a C++ novice).</p>
<p><em>Of course you should use your own path here</em>. That was easy and fast. What are you waiting for? Do it for yourself.</p>
<h1><a class="header" href="#boost-libraries-on-osx---first-obstacles" id="boost-libraries-on-osx---first-obstacles">Boost libraries on OSX - first obstacles</a></h1>
<p>Building the boost/filesystem library was quite easy, using it in a program not so much. It compiled fine but when I started I got</p>
<pre><code>dyld: Library not loaded: libboost_filesystem.dylib
  Referenced from: ___path_to_the_program_I_started___
  Reason: image not found
</code></pre>
<p>It's a dynamic library, which means that I must take care of the application bundle on OSX. When I transfer the application to another Mac that has - certainly - not its own copy of the libraries. But on my own computer?
Let's have a look. Walked in the directory with the <code>.dylib</code> file.</p>
<pre><code>otool -L ./libboost_filesystem.dylib 
./libboost_filesystem.dylib:
	libboost_filesystem.dylib (compatibility version 0.0.0, current version 0.0.0)
	libboost_system.dylib (compatibility version 0.0.0, current version 0.0.0)
	/usr/lib/libstdc++.6.dylib (compatibility version 7.0.0, current version 52.0.0)
	/usr/lib/libSystem.B.dylib (compatibility version 1.0.0, current version 159.1.0)
</code></pre>
<p>Looks not so bad, there is no absolute path to <code>/usr/somewhere</code> in the library file. But hat also means that the system can not find the library while starting the program. And that brings me back to the <em>&quot;copy them to your application bundle&quot;</em> problem.</p>
<p><a href="http://qin.laya.com/tech_coding_help/dylib_linking.html">No absolute path</a> is not perfect in the OSX world, there is a need for a <code>@executable_path/../Frameworks</code> path in the library. So a compiled program will look in the Frameworks folder, relative from its own position.</p>
<p>Do I really need to recompile the Boost libraries or can I tell QtCreator to do the job for me?
In the Qt helpfiles is a chapter called <em>Qt for Mac OS X - Specific Issues</em> where it reads</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If you want to use some dynamic libraries in your Mac OS X application bundle (the application directory), create a subdirectory named &quot;Frameworks&quot; in the application bundle directory and place your dynamic libraries there. The application will find a dynamic library if it has the install name <code>@executable_path/../Frameworks/libname.dylib</code> (that goes for both, the program binary and the library).
If you use qmake and Makefiles, use the QMAKE_LFLAGS_SONAME setting:</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><code>MAKE_LFLAGS_SONAME  = -Wl,-install_name,@executable_path/../Frameworks/</code></p>
</blockquote>
<p>A quick lookup in the <code>qmake Variable Reference</code> is not very enlightening:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This variable specifies the link flags to set the name of shared objects, such as .so or .dll. The value of this variable is typically handled by qmake or qmake.conf and rarely needs to be modified.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The Qt project claims to have a good documentation. Well, I beg to differ. So far every time the tiny bits are missing when it goes into the important details that everyone will come across on the OSX platform or using Qt in general. If you are experienced in using compilers that question may never come up, but for a C++ novice like me it is fundamental. I don't know if the <em>qmake variable</em> is simply a placeholder for a compiler setting. And if it is, I'd like to know <em>that</em> it is that way and <em>where</em> to look for the meaning of it.</p>
<p><em>Lazy solution</em></p>
<p>Removing the <code>*.dylib</code> files from the <code>boost_1_53_0/stage/lib</code> directory forces the linker to use the <code>*.a</code> files and that results in static linking. Easy way out but not a perfect solution. There are libraries that can't be used with static linking and be it just for licensing reasons. <a href="http://qt-project.org/doc/qt-4.8/deployment-mac.html">This article from qt.project.org</a> goes into some of the details. Using the <em>The Mac Deployment Tool</em> will be covered in another post.</p>
